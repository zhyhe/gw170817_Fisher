In the *_stationary we did not consider the effect of earth rotation. In the *_general we consider this effect.



Fisher_LIGO.F is the code to calculate the Fisher matrix, input 4 detector parameters, 9 Fisher parameters, the detector's noise curve, the line of the detector's noise curve. You will get the 9*9 Fisher matrix and the event's SNR. This Code is for LIGO-type detectors. Please check step(;) while you want to use other detectors.



di.F is the code to calculate the whitened data in the frequency domain. Term1 is the time delay compared with the center of earth. The functions are in the detector_position.F and source_direction.F. Term2 is the detector's noise strain. Term3 is the binary neutron star inspriral's waveform, the code is in HF2_GR.F.



INVERSE_FISHER.F is used to calculate the inverse matrix of the Fisher matrix. The \Delta\Omega_{s} and \Delta \ln(dL) are calculated in Delta_Omega_cal.F.



t_c.F is the code to tranform the UTC to sidereal time. And dL.F is the code to transform z to dL with H_{0} = 67.3 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, \Omega_{Lambda} = 0.685, \Omega_{m} = 0.315.
